Windows 7 Security Assessment Report (Lab Environment)
1. Overview
This document summarizes the security assessment activities performed on a Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 virtual machine in a controlled lab environment. The goal of this exercise was to practice service enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and documentation for a cybersecurity portfolio.
2. Initial Service Enumeration
The following services were identified using Nmap:
- TCP 135 – MSRPC
- TCP 139 – NetBIOS-SSN
- TCP 445 – SMB (Microsoft-DS)
- TCP 49152–49157 – MSRPC Dynamic Ports
- UDP 137 – NetBIOS-NS
- UDP 138 – NetBIOS-DGM
- UDP 500 – ISAKMP
- UDP 4500 – NAT-T IKE
- UDP 5355 – LLMNR
3. SMB Version Scan Results
Using the Metasploit module `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`, the following information was collected:
• SMB versions supported: 1, 2
• Preferred dialect: SMB 2.1
• OS detected: Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (Build 7601)
• Authentication domain: WINDOWS-7
4. MS17-010 Vulnerability Check (EternalBlue)
The Metasploit module `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010` was used to determine whether the target was vulnerable to MS17-010 (EternalBlue). The result:
→ Host does NOT appear vulnerable.
This indicates that the Windows 7 target is patched or configured in a way that does not permit MS17-010 exploitation.
5. MS10-061 Print Spooler Assessment
The Metasploit module `exploit/windows/smb/ms10_061_spoolss` was tested. Even with proper configuration of RHOSTS, LHOST, and PNAME (e.g., 'XPS Document Writer'), the attempt returned STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED. This confirms that the Print Spooler attack surface was not vulnerable on this Windows 7 build.
6. Key Findings
- SMBv1 is present but not vulnerable.
- Windows 7 SP1 (Build 7601) is patched against EternalBlue.
- Print Spooler vulnerability MS10-061 is not exploitable on this host.
- MSRPC, NetBIOS, and LLMNR services are present but did not expose remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in this configuration.
7. Conclusion
The assessment demonstrated correct enumeration and vulnerability-checking methodology. Although no exploitable vulnerabilities were found—which is expected for a patched Windows 7 SP1 machine—the process and documentation reflect real-world penetration testing workflow. This report can be used in a portfolio to showcase accurate scanning, verification, and security analysis skills.
